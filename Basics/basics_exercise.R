# Exercise
# 1. What is two to the power of five
print(2 ^ 5)

# 2. Create a vector called stock.prices with the following data points: 23,27,23,21,34
stock.prices <- c(23,27,23,21,34)
print(stock.prices)
# 3. Assign names to the price data points relating to the day of the week, starting with Monday
names(stock.prices) <- c('Mon', 'Tue' ,'Wed','Thu','Fri')
print(stock.prices)
# 4. What was the average stock price for the week
average = mean(stock.prices)
print(average)

# 5. Create a vector called over.23 consisting of logicals that corresponds to the days where the stock price was more than $23
over.23 <- stock.prices > 23
print(over.23)

# 6. Use the over.23 vector to filter out the stock.prices vector and only return the day and prices where the price was over $23
print(stock.prices[over.23])

# 7. Use a built-in function to find the day the price was the highest
stock.prices[stock.prices == max(stock.prices)] # This returns the date
